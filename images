<h2>Welcome To Our Website</h2>
<p>The Mission for WOMEN Empowerment was launched by the students of miet with the aim to strengthen overall processes that promote all-round Development of Women.

It has the mandate to strengthen the inter-sector convergence; facilitate the process of coordinating all the womenâ€™s welfare and socio-economic development programmes across ministries and departments.  The Mission aims to provide a single window service for all programmes run by the Government for Women under aegis of various Central Ministries.

In light with its mandate, the Mission has been named Mission Poorna Shakti, implying a vision for holistic empowerment of women.

The National Resource Center for Women has been set up which functions as a national convergence center for all schemes and programmes for women. It acts as a central repository of knowledge, information, research and data on all gender related issues and is the main body servicing the National and State Mission Authority.

Mission Statement

To strengthen the processes which promote holistic development and empowerment of women, gender equality and gender justice through inter-sectoral convergence of programmes that impact women, forge synergy among various stakeholders and create an enabling environment conducive to social change.
